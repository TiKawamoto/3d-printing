# TK21 Open Coldcard Case
This is the freely available version of the TK21 Coldcard Case that can be purchased from [CryptoCloaks](https://www.cryptocloaks.com/product/tk21-coldcard-case/).

The case currently fits all Coldcard Wallet models (Mk1-Mk3) and has openings for accessing both the micro USB port and the SD card. The case also features the same accessory rail system found on the version available for sale at CryptoCloaks, so it is compatible with both the Coldcard stand and Mag Clamp accessories.

Designed in Autodesk Fusion 360, built around the [Coldcard Wallet Volumetric Model](https://github.com/TiKawamoto/3d-printing/tree/master/Coldcard)

## For 3D Printing
This is the hardware / settings combo I used to successfully print this model.

**Note:** You may experience some warping / lifting at the corners, particularly if you are not running an enclosure or have temperature/humidity issues. The best way to get a clean print in this case is to use a 10mm brim to keep everything adhered to the bed.

**Printer -** Creality Ender 3 Pro  
**Bed type -** Glass  
**Nozzle Diameter -** 0.4mm  
**Slicer -** Cura 4.6.1  
**Print Orientation -** Laying down with the button side facing up.  

**Material -** PLA  
**Extruder / Bed Temp -** 205°C / 60°C  
**Layer Height -** 0.2mm
**Line Width -** 0.4mm  
**Infill -** 0%
